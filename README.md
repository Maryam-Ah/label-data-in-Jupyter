# label-data-in-Jupyter
Pigeon is a simple widget that lets you quickly annotate a dataset of unlabeled examples from the comfort of your Jupyter notebook.  Pigeon currently supports annotation for classification tasks (set of labels), regression tasks (int/float range), or captioning tasks (variable-length text). Anything that can be displayed on Jupyter (text, images, audio, graphs, etc.) can be displayed by pigeon by providing the appropriate display_fn argument.
